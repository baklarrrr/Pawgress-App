# MB World Project Tracker

This repository contains a minimal PyQt6 application for managing tasks in Mercedes-Benz World projects. The app provides two lists – one for pending tasks and another for completed tasks – backed by a local SQLite database. Tasks can be added with a priority, automatically sorted, and marked as done.

Run `mb_world_tracker.py` to launch the interface.
